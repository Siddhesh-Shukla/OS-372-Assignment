## OS-Assignment-1 (Sudoku Solver Using Threads)

- Write a C program to solve an `NxN sudoku puzzle` by brute force. 
- The program should be compatible on an Ubuntu machine running `18.04` or `20.04`. 
- `0 < N <= 36` N is a perfect square. The value of N will be supplied as a command line argument. 
- The grid to be solved will be supplied as a text file as a command line argument. 
- Empty cells in the grid have `0`. Numbers greater than 9 will be represented by the number itself. 
- So, your program should run as : `./sudoku.out N input.txt`
- The program should print the solved grid on the standard output in a tab separated format, similar to the input.
